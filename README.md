# Numpy

What is NumPy?
----------------
--> Numpy is the fundamental pachage for scientific computing in Python.
--> NumPy is a Python library tat provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects.


What is NumPy Array??
---------------------
--> An array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to locate an element, and how to interact an element.


Advantages of using NumPy Arrays Over Python List
-------------------------------------------------
      --> Consumes less memory
      --> fast as compared to the Python List
      --> Convenient to use.

Installation & Import NumPy
------------------------------
  Installation
  ------------
      pip install numpy

  Import Numpy
  ---------------
      Import numpy as np

Importance of NumPy in Python
-----------------------------
    --> Wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays
    --> It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.
    --> Mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear Algrbra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
    

NumPy V/S Python List
-----------------------
    NumPy arrays and Python lists are both used to store collections of data, but they have key differences:
  1. Data Type:
    NumPy Array: Stores elements of the same data type, making operations more efficient.
    Python List: Can store elements of different data types, providing flexibility.

  2. Performance:
    NumPy Array:
    Highly optimized for numerical computations, offering faster performance due to underlying C implementation.
    Python List:
    Slower for numerical operations due to the overhead of Python's dynamic typing and interpreted nature.

3. Functionality:
    NumPy Array: Provides a wide range of mathematical functions and operations optimized for arrays, such as element-wise calculations, linear algebra, and statistical analysis.
    Python List: Offers basic operations like adding, removing, and accessing elements.

4. Memory Management:
    NumPy Array: More efficient memory management as elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
    Python List: Less efficient memory management as elements can be scattered in memory.

5. Mutability:
    NumPy Array: Elements can be modified (mutable) but the size of the array is fixed.
    Python List: Elements can be modified (mutable) and the size of the list can be changed dynamically.


In summary:
    Use NumPy arrays for numerical computations and scientific computing, where speed and efficiency are crucial.
    Use Python lists for general-purpose tasks that require flexibility in storing different data types.

# Numpy

What is NumPy?
----------------
--> Numpy is the fundamental pachage for scientific computing in Python.
--> NumPy is a Python library tat provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects.


What is NumPy Array??
---------------------
--> An array is a grid of values and it contains information about the raw data, how to locate an element, and how to locate an element, and how to interact an element.


NumPy V/S Python List
-----------------------
  Advantages of using NumPy Arrays Over Python List
  -------------------------------------------------
      --> Consumes less memory
      --> fast as compared to the Python List
      --> Convenient to use.

Installation & Import NumPy
------------------------------
  Installation
  ------------
      pip install numpy

  Import Numpy
  ---------------
      Import numpy as np

Importance of NumPy in Python
-----------------------------
    --> Wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays
    --> It supplies an enormous library of high-level mathematical functions that operate on these arrays and matrices.
    --> Mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear Algrbra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.
